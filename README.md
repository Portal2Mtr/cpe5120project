# CpE 5120 Course Project
This project simulates a CDC6600 and CDC7600 by executing 
target programs and reporting the performance 
(in terms of the number of clock pulses). Our chosen language for this project is Python, which allows 
for easy abstraction of unique data types.



Test data input strings can be selected via the short input script.
For each test data input, the simulator executes the instruction pipe, scoreboard, 
delivery of instructions to the functional units, and execution of the instructions 
in the processor, for both CDC6600 and CDC7600.  In addition, the simulator
generates two time tables (time charts) (similar to the ones discussed in the class 
notes) in terms of the number of clock pulses showing the time progress of the 
instructions in the programs.
